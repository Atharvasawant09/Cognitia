Ancient Greek civilization, the period following Mycenaean civilization, which ended about 1200 BCE, to the death of Alexander the Great, in 323 BCE. It was a period of political, philosophical, artistic, and scientific achievements that formed a legacy with unparalleled influence on Western civilization. The Greek Dark Ages (c. 1100 - c. 800 BC) refers to the period of Greek history from the presumed Dorian invasion and end of the Mycenaean civilization in the 11th century BC to the rise of the first Greek city-states in the 9th century BC and the epics of Homer and earliest writings in the Greek alphabet in the 8th century BC. Ancient Greek civilization - Culture, Philosophy, Democracy: Between 500 and 386 bce Persia was for the policy-making classes in the largest Greek states a constant preoccupation. (It is not known, however, how far down the social scale this preoccupation extended in reality.)

Ancient Greek civilization - Athenian Empire, City-States, Democracy: The eastern Greeks of the islands and mainland felt themselves particularly vulnerable and appealed to the natural leader, Sparta.

Glacier melt and sea level rise information:

Summary: Between 1901 and 2018, the average sea level rose by 15-25 cm (6-10 in), with an increase of 2.3 mm (0.091 in) per year since the 1970s.: 1216  This was faster than the sea level had ever risen over at least the past 3,000 years.: 1216  The rate accelerated to 4.62 mm (0.182 in)/yr for the decade 2013–2022. Climate change due to human activities is the main cause.: 5, 8  Between 1993 and 2018, melting ice sheets and glaciers accounted for 44% of sea level rise, with another 42% resulting from thermal expansion of water.: 1576 

Sea level rise lags behind changes in the Earth's temperature by decades, and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened. What happens after that depends on future human greenhouse gas emissions. If there are very deep cuts in emissions, sea level rise would slow between 2050 and 2100. It could then reach by 2100 between 30 cm (1 ft) and 1.0 m (3+1⁄3 ft)
